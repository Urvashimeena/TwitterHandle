# TwitterHandle
We make a simple page that has a simple input box where we can enter a Twitter Handle and click
on a Submit button.
Clicking on the submit button should display answers to the following things below it:
  a. How many followers does that handle have?
  b. How many tweets has that handle done?
  c. The latest tweet that has been done by that handle.<br>
    <b>Followers</b> 12345<br>
